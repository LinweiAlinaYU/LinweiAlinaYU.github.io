In November 2023, as a **Volunteer Helper**, I participated in the **Innovation and Inquiry: 2023 Integrated STEM Experiential Camp**, organized by the Macau Education and Youth Development Bureau and hosted by the Faculty of Education of the University of Macau, and assisted in the thematic inquiry activity of the **senior high school section - Optics to Astronomy Exploration**.

This iSTEM Camp aims to provide students with the opportunity to learn through application and practice, to acquire integrated application skills, and to develop students' abilities in creative inquiry, practice and innovation, problem-solving and technology application. Through the original design of educational activities and thematic inquiry activities, students were able to utilize cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills in the process of scientific inquiry, which stimulated their innovative thinking and integrated application skills.

After repeated discussions, reflections, and modifications with the lecturer, students were allowed to embark on a journey to explore the universe from the perspective of historical scientists, explore the principles of optics, make a "Newtonian reflecting telescope" by themselves, and further observe the universe under the night sky, listen to the story of the night sky and experience the mysteries of the universe.

Participants in the activity said that they enjoyed the creative and collaborative process of scientific investigation. By completing the tasks together, they not only gained a deep understanding of the relevant scientific knowledge and skills, but also stimulated their imagination and creativity, and gained a deeper understanding of the new technological tools.
