In 2021/2022, I served as the **Associate House Leader** of the House of Integrated Science major. After that, I served as the **House Leader** of the House of Integrated Science in the 2022/2023 academic year. During my tenure, led the House to achieve **The Most Active House Award 2022/2023** and **The Academically Outstanding House Award 2022/2023**


**House Programme** is a specific program of the Faculty of Education (FED) of the University of Macau. Each House will contain students from all year levels of the major. Under the leadership of the House Leader and Associate House Leader, students will communicate with each other and conduct a series of academic sharing activities and extracurricular break activities. The main objectives of the House Programme are to build and strengthen relationships among students in the same major, to create a peer-caring atmosphere, and to build students' pride in their major and a sense of belonging to it.

During my tenure as House Leader in the House Programme, I attempted to establish communication with students of all years in my major, organized communication activities, helped freshmen to adapt to the new life in the university, encouraged teamwork, increased the sense of belonging of the house members, and led the house to achieve **The Most Active House Award 2022/2023**.

In terms of learning, I encouraged house members to study hard, help each other, and give full expression to the spirit of peer-to-peer motivation and support, and led the house to achieve **The Academically Outstanding House Award 2022/2023** _(the highest cumulative CGPA of House members in the current academic year)_.
