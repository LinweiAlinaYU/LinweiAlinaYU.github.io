In the academic year 2023/2024, I participated as a Mentee in the **Alumni Mentorship Scheme**, which was co-organized by the Alumni and Development Office (ADO) and the Career Development Centre (CDC) of the University of Macau. In this scheme, I was inspired a lot by my _**Mentor Mr. Ping-Lung FONG**_, and finally received the **Outstanding Mentee Award**.

The aim of the "Alumni Mentorship Scheme" is to promote the alumni spirit, to encourage alumni to provide more opportunities for current students to get in touch with society, as well as to build up a mentor-mentee relationship between alumni and students. During the program, I made a mutual match with Mr. Ping-Lung FONG, a senior technician and principal consultant of the Macau Education and Youth Development Bureau, who shared with me a lot of experiences, achievements, and methods related to educational research, the current situation of the education industry in Macau, and provided me with certain suggestions for my future study plan. I have benefited a lot from him.

As my Mentor in this program, in nominating me as a candidate for the Outstanding Mentee Award, Mr. FONG comments: **"Alina can well-control her time. And she has a mature self-understanding, knows her specialties and abilities, actively plans and prepares for possible options for graduate studies, and works hard to become an outstanding teacher and a good researcher."**
