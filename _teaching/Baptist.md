Under the supervision and guidance of **_[Prof. Bing WEI](https://fed.um.edu.mo/zh-hant/bing-wei/)(Supervisor)_** and **_MS. Ka-Ming TSANG (Mentor)_**, I have completed 11 weeks of supervised teaching and school experience, from **5th October 2023 to 19th December 2023**. I participated in the teaching of junior high school grade 2 Chemistry, junior high school grade 3 Chemistry, and senior high school grade 2 Scientific Inquiry for 5 classes in total, specific works including giving lectures, lab class teaching, assessment, etc.

Specifically, the chemistry teaching work for junior high school grade 2 mainly focuses on _Unit 2 - The Air Around Us_ and _Unit 4 - Water in Nature_. The teaching for junior high school grade 3 mainly centered on _Unit 9 - Solutions_. And for the senior high grade 2 Scientific Inquiry course, the teaching of _Unit 9 - Acid and Base_ was mainly carried out. Among them, my specific work includes **giving lectures**, **lab class teaching**, **review courses teaching**, **exercise tutorials**, and **assessments**.

It is worth mentioning that during my teaching, I experienced the transformative potential of technology-enhanced education. The use of tools like **NOBOOK's virtual laboratory** demonstrated how innovative technology could facilitate complex experimental activities safely and effectively in classrooms.

I have benefited immensely from this teaching experience, which provided me with an opportunity to put the theoretical knowledge I learned in the previous three years into practice, helping me familiarize myself with the actual teaching process, enhancing my teaching practice ability, and enabling me to better understand the current education situation in Macau schools.
