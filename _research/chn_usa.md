Under the guidance of the projectâ€™s principal investigator _**[Prof. Bing WEI](https://fed.um.edu.mo/zh-hant/bing-wei/)**_, I assisted in STEM education policy research of the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy published in the United States (ITEEA, 2020), and The Science Curriculum Standards of Compulsory Education (the 2020 version) in China (MoE, 2020). 

Specifically, I conducted **literature review** and conducted **content analysis**. The content analysis and coding work for each policy centered around its systematic figure.
