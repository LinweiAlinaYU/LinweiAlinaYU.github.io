Hollow glass microsphere (HGM) is a kind of hollow closed sphere, which has the advantages of low density, stable chemical properties, reusable, excellent compression resistance, high adsorption capacity, high selectivity, etc. HGM has been widely used in aerospace, petroleum industry, thermal insulation materials, and other fields. Due to the unique structure and chemical properties of HGM, it has extremely high potential value in the field of wastewater treatment, and is an ideal carrier for preparing adsorbents with self-floating adsorbents. Modifying it with specific functional groups can enhance the adsorption capacity for specific pollutants and improve the adsorption selectivity.

In the review paper, the preparation process of self-floating separation adsorbent, the modification of HGM and the factors affecting the adsorption effect are reviewed, and the application range of HGM is extended to the preparation of adsorption materials. Our review paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for the application of HGM in wastewater treatment, and for relevant researchers to develop adsorbent materials with HGM as the main body, clarify ideas, and explore the potential of developing HGM into practice for large-scale wastewater treatment.
